# Guides

Welcome to my **Guides** repository!

This repository contains a collection of step-by-step guides documenting various solutions and methodologies I have used. Mostly to save me the effort of reasearching and trying the same things over and over again. The guides cover a range of topics, basicially everything which I am interested in. Maybe you find something usefull or interesting. Enjoy!
